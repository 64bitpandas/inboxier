# inboxy: Google Inbox-style bundles for Gmail

inboxy is a browser extension that bundles together your email messages and makes it easier to manage
your inbox. 

Available for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inboxy-inbox-bundles-for/clahkkinbdcdnogkkgmacmiknnamahha) 
and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/inboxy-inbox-bundles-for-gmail/).

## Features

* Messages with the same label are bundled together in your inbox
* Archive all bundled messages on the current page quickly
* Star a message to pin it outside of its bundle
* Intuitive date headings
* Supports light and dark themes

## Setup

inboxy uses webpack to bundle js files:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build with webpack to create dist/content.js
npm run build
```

The `dist` directory can then be loaded as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted).
